### Locks (Chapter 28)

* Why do we need locks?
* What are the possible states of a _lock_?
* What are the semantics of a call to `lock()`?
* What are the semantics of a call to `unlock()`?
* What three metrics do we use to measure the quality of a _lock_?
* What are the drawbacks of implementing locks by _disabling interrupts_?
  * OS loses control
  * does not work with multiprocessors
  * slow to disable interrupts

* What is _spin waiting_?

* How does a spin lock work?
  * What does it require from the hardware?
    * test-and-set or compare-and-swap
  * What are the drawbacks?
    * starvation possible
    * wasted CPU resources
* How do _test-and-set_ and _compare-and-swap_ differ?
* What is the advantage of ticket locks over simple spinlocks?
  * no starvation
  
* Why does the code in Fig. 28.9 (locks with queues) test-and-set `guard` instead of `flag`?

```C
typedef struct{
  int flag;
  int guard;
  queue_t * q;
} lock _t;

void lock_init(lock_t * m) {
  m->flag  = 0;
  m->guard = 0;
  queue_init(m->q);
}
...

```

* Why is spin waiting in the `QueueLock` better than spin waiting in general?
  * limited to spin waiting on lock that guards the queue, not the general lock
* What does `park` & `unpark` do in `Solaris`?
* What would happen if we released the `guard` lock after the `park(...)` in `QueueLock`?
* Could we use a `compare-and-swap` in `QueueLocks` instead of `test-and-set`?
* What is the advantage of two-phase locks?
