* What is the overriding goal of PS schedulers?
* Generalized Processor Sharing
* What is the basic idea behind lottery scheduling?
* What purpose does ticket currency serve?
* What about ticket transfer?
* What if a process misses a bunch of drawings because it was doing I/O?
  * should it get some compensation?
* What is stride scheduling?
* How does stride scheduling implement PS?
  * stride = cost to run
  * pass = accumulated cost
  * run smallest pass next
* What should the pass be set for a new process?
  * 0?
  * smallest pass? (what if its unimportant?)
  * largest pass? (what if its really important?) others?
* What should the pass be for a process that returns from I/O?
  * pass from before? (what if it was gone for along time?)
  * 0?
  * smallest?
  * largest?
* What is the complexity of selecting the next process in lottery?
  * stride?
* Does this help solve the process limit problem?
  * X & Y share a machine. X has 100 web browsers open
