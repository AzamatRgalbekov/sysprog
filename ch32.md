### Concurrency Bugs (Chapter 32)

* What is an atomicity-violation bug?
  * non-atomic memory updates
  * ATM example
  * how do we fix them in general?
* What is an order-violation bug?
  * a specific ordering of operations is required, but not enforced
  * how is this generally fixed?
  * What are the four conditions that must hold for deadlock to occur? (explain in your own words)
* What are the differences in attitudes of deadlock prevention, avoidance, and detect/recover?
* How can we prevent circular waiting?
  * problems?
* How can we prevent hold-and-wait?
  * grab all locks at once, atomically
  * what are the problems with this approach?
* How can we prevent no preemption?
  * try lock & release all other locks if cannot obtain
  * how is this similar to hold-and-wait prevention technique?
* How can we prevent mutual exclusion?
  * wait-free data structures
  * is this a practical approach?
* What is livelock?
* Which of the four deadlock conditions does deadlock avoidance via scheduling attempt to remove?
  * Why is this impractical?
* Which approach do you think is the most common?
  * bury head in sand and hope they deadlock doesn't happen
* What is the primary difference in the causes of non-deadlock bugs vs. deadlock bugs?
  * non-deadlocking => not enough control (locks, CV, etc...)
  * deadlock => using control wrong
