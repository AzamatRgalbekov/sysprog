### Concurrency and Threads (Chapter 26)

* How does the thread creation interface presented in this chapter differ from `fork()`?
* Say we had a new syscall, `thread_fork()`, that made a new thread that started at the return of this call. How would this differ from `fork()`?
* Do we need to flush the _TLB_ when context switching between threads in the same process?
* What is a _race condition_?
* How are _race conditions_ and _critical sections_ related?
* How does _mutual exclusion_ prevent race conditions?
* How does _atomicity_ prevent race conditions?
* Why are atomic instructions an impractical solution, by themselves, to prevent race conditions?
  * would need an atomic operation for every possible use case: add to a queue, insert into a  b-tree, etc..
* What does it mean for a program to be deterministic?
* What does it mean for a program to be indeterminate?
