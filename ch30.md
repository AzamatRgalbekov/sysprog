### Condition Variables (Chapter 30)

* What problems do *condition variables* solve that *locks* cannot?
  * efficiently wait for a condition to be true
* What is a mutex?
* Why must a thread be holding a lock to wait on a condition variable?
  * usually (almost always) waiting for some variable to change state, must be sure of its value before waiting because otherwise variable might change state right before thread blocks
  * similarly, without the lock, cannot guarantee some other thread isn\'t signaling right now
  * in short, deadlock
* Why can\'t `wait` & `unlock` be separate calls done back-to-back?
  * `unlock(...);` (variable may change here) `wait(...);`
* Why should a wait always occur in a loop?
  * what does *Mesa* semantics mean?
    * signaled condition a hint, not a guarantee
  * what is a spurious wakeup?
* Why must we have a separate condition variable per desired condition? (illustrate your answer using producer/consumer problem)
* What would be better names for the condition variables `empty` and `fill` in the producer/consumer solution in the book?
