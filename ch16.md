### Segmentation (Chapter 16)

* What is a sparse address space?
  * how do they affect simple (non-segmented) base and bounds virtual memory systems?
* Why does base and bound fail for processes with address spaces larger than physical memory?
* What is a segment?
* Why can't we simply add the base physical address of the heap segment to an address in the heap?
  * because heap VA space doesn't start at 0
* What is the difference between explicit and implicit segment references?
  * how do we get the offset for explicit?
  * segments laid out in VA so leading bits determine segment (segment slots)
  * remaining bits are offset
* Why is the stack difficult to segment?
  * grows backwards (base is actually largest address)
  * explicit bits give us start of segment "slot", not base address
    * offset must be recalculated from end of segment slot
* Why would we ever want to share a segment across processes?
* Why do we need protection bits for shared segments?
  * why are protection bits only necessary if we have shared segments?
  * a process cannot access another processes segments without sharing
  * how does the OS prevent this?
* Where are protection bits for segments stored?
  * in address?
  * in OS?
  * in hardware?
  * why?
* What provides support for multiple segments OS or hardware?
  * both, hardware provides registers, OS does bookkeeping
* What is the difference between internal and external fragmentation?
* What happens if a segment needs to grow? 
  * What if there is no room (contiguously)?
  * can this happen in simple b&b?
