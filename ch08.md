### Chapter 8 - MultiLevel FeedBack Queue

* What are the goals of MLFQ?
  * minimize response time
  * minimize turnaround time
 
* How is an MLFQ scheduler built?
* Why are shot jobs considered interactive and CPU-bound jobs considered to not have response time priority?
* Where do new jobs enter MLFQ?
  * to what end?
* What happens when a jobs uses its entire time slice?
  * to what end?
* How does MLFQ approximate SJF?
* What is starvation?
  * is it possible to starve in MLFQ? why (not)?
* What is "gaming the system/scheduler"?
  * is it possible in MLFQ?
* Does the anti-gaming rule 4 stop cheating & minimize TT for short jobs?
  * what if my job legitimately uses just about a whole timeslice and then does I/O?
* What is the longest a process can go without being scheduled in MLFQ?
  * S + top priority timeslice * # of processes
  * is this a hard bound (no because of # of processes)
* How can we measure fairness?
  * what illusion does CPU virtualization provide?
  * Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS)
* Is MLFQ fair?
