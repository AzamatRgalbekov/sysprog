### Limited Direct Execution (Chapter 6)

* What does architecture mean?
  * How does it differ from OS?
* What is the key question/problem addressed in this chapter?
  * Why not just run processes directly on the CPU & let them yield when done?
  * Why not have the OS fetch, decode, & execute each instruction of a program instead?
* What is an interrupt?

* **Restricted Operations**
* Why are there restricted operations for processes?
* What is user mode? kernel mode?
  * What type of operations are restricted in user-mode?
  * who/what provides these two modes?
*  How does a process get things done that require restricted operations?
* What does a system call do?
* Who/what provides the trap/return for trap instructions?
* How does the CPU know which code to run when a trap occurs?

* **Context Switching**
* How does direct execution make it difficult for the OS to switch between processes?
* How does the OS solve this problem?
  * What is the difference between the cooperative and non-cooperative approach to context switching?
* How do they work?
  * What are the drawbacks of cooperative approach?
  * What are the drawbacks of non-cooperative approach?
  * how does the CPU know what code to run when the timer interrupt occurs?
* What does the scheduler do (in the simplest terms)?
* How does limited direct execution allow the OS to virtualize the CPU?
