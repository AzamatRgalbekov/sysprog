### Chapter 7 (Scheduling)

**Introduction**
* What is a workload?
* Why are the initial workload assumptions in 7.1 unrealistic?
* What scheduling metrics are discussed in the book?
  * can you think of others?
  * how can we measure fairness?
  * how can we measure proportionality?
* What is the difference between preemptive and nonpreemtive schedulers?
  * What are the drawbacks of non-preemptive schedulers?
  * What are the drawbacks of preemptive schedulers?

**FIFO/FCFS**
* What is FIFO?
  * what data structures would we use?
* What drawback does FIFO have?
  * what is the convoy effect?
* Does FIFO trade performance for fairness?

**SJF**
* How does SJF improve over FIFO?
* What are its limitations?
* Is it fair?
* What if there are a lot of small jobs and a few long ones?

**STCF**
* How does STCF improve over SJF?
* What is response time?
* How well does STCF minimize response time?
* Is STCF fair?

**RR**
* What is a time slice?
* Why donâ€™t we make the time slice really small (1 instruction)?
* How does RR minimize response time?
* What is the max response time for a newly arrived job?
* Is RR fair?
* How does RR perform in terms of turnaround-time?
* If N jobs all arrived simultaneously, which one would finish first?

**I/O**
* How does I/O affect our model of CPU scheduling?
* Why should we treat jobs that do I/O as a series of separate jobs?
* Are there any disadvantages to do this?
